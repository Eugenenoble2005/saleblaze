<h1>Saleblaze</h1>

<p>
Saleblaze is a platform that allows sellers, merchants and MSMEs to maximize their financial capabilities. It digitalizes day to day tasks of businesses like bookkeeping, managing staff and recording purchases which eradicates the volatility and stress of manual record keeping. Creating a safer and more concise financial situation.

Saleblaze also works to eradicate the existing barrier that hinders businesses from having easy access to credit and loans. It does this by generating a financial statement of a business in a particular financial period which includes financial records and former credit performance. This credible financial report can be given to FSPs to immediately determine a business's eligibility for credit.</p>
